[] Consider adding an actual scene camera (we will be able to see "game" cameras in "scene" view as)

[~] Add position and rotation control for the cube
{
    [] Add mouse controlled position control (something like holding space and then dragging to move the object) and object rotation control (like in any 3d model viewer). Currently it is driven by DearImGui form fields which does the job but is cumbersome to use.
}

[~] 3d model loading using Assimp
{
    [~] Materials and textures, for now only basic materials that have diffuse, specular and normal maps.
    {
        [~] Make sure that where ever we return null or 0 in our model code we handle it properly: Implemented but not tested
    }
    [] Refer render.h for comments on issues with current model loading code. Try to resolve those issues!
    [] Debug imgui tree to view material details
}

[] Memory management
{
    [] Currently i don't have a clear picture of how I would handle memory as I don't have a good use case. For now I have allocated a fixed memory block for the entire lifetime of application, there is no way to free parts of memory block, defrag etc. Think about a system that servers our use case and replace the current bare bones system.
