[] Implement and understand perspective projection
{
    [x] Create perspective projection matrix and use it to render the cube
    [] Add position control and then rotation control to the camera so that it behaves like a "scene" camera
    [] Consider adding an actual scene camera (we will be able to see "game" cameras in "scene" view as)
}

[~] Render a cube
{
    [X] Setup vertex and fragment shaders
    [~] Setup textures
    {
        [] Consider adding mipmaps
    }
}

[X] Fix Aspect Ratio, it should render a cube not a cuboid
[~] Add position and rotation control for the cube
{
    [] Add mouse controlled position control (something like holding space and then dragging to move the object) and object rotation control (like in any 3d model viewer). Currently it is driven by DearImGui form fields which does the job but is cumbersome to use.
}
